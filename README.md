<h1 align="center">Nebularis Engine</h1>

Currently, **Nebularis Engine** provides the following:

- **Planet and Star Visualization**: Display of planets orbiting a star with smooth animations.
- **3D Rendering**: Graphics using **Three.js** to represent space and celestial bodies.

Planned Future Features:

- **Realistic Physics Simulation**: Implementation of gravitational calculations and precise orbital simulations.
- **Interactivity**: Control parameters such as orbit speed, planet positions, and camera perspectives.
- **Collisions and Dynamics**: Implementation of collisions between planets, stars, and other celestial bodies, along with more complex physical interactions.
- **Interactive Interface**: A panel for users to adjust and visualize simulations in real time.
