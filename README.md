<h1 align="center">Nebularis Engine</h1>

<p align=center>Nebularis Engine allows the user to create and simulate space experiences, featuring realistic physics and orbital calculation of celestial bodies.</p>

## Currently, **Nebularis Engine** provides the following:

- **Planet and Star Visualization**: Displays planets orbiting the sun with smooth animations.
- **3D Rendering**: Use `three.js` to represent space and celestial bodies with realistic graphics.
- **Camera Movement**: Allows simple camera navigation with keyboard and mouse inputs.

## Planned Future Features:

- **Realistic Physics Simulation**: Implementation of gravitational calculations and precise orbital simulations.
- **Interactivity**: Control parameters such as orbit speed, planet positions, and camera perspectives.
- **Collisions and Dynamics**: Implementation of collisions between planets, stars, and other celestial bodies, along with more complex physical interactions.
- **Interactive Interface**: A panel for users to create and visualize simulations in real time.
